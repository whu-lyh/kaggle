> 内容描述

```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## 解题方案


> 思路1

对于从第一天后的每一天，我们都假设昨天就已经卖掉了，那么现在我们可以看看**如果昨天卖可以赚的钱加上今天与昨天股票的价格差价**是否大于0，如果大于0就说明今天卖赚的更多，那么我们就还是先存下今天卖可以多赚的max_cur，继续往后看，如果小于0就还是坚持昨天可以赚的钱（即之前的max_cur）

All the straight forward solution should work, but if the interviewer twists the question slightly 
by giving the difference array of prices, Ex: for ```{1, 7, 4, 11}```, if he gives ```{0, 6, -3, 7}```, 
you might end up being confused.

Here, the logic is to calculate the difference ```(maxCur += prices[i] - prices[i-1])```
of the original array, and find a contiguous subarray giving maximum profit. 
If the difference falls below ```0```, reset it to zero.

参考[Maximum subarray problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem), 
[Kadane's Algorithm](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/19853/kadane-s-algorithm-since-no-one-has-mentioned-about-this-so-far-in-case-if-interviewer-twists-the-input)


```
Why maxCur = Math.max(0, maxCur += prices[i] - prices[i-1]); ?

Well, we can assume opt(i) as the max Profit you will get if you sell the stock at day i;

We now face two situations:

We hold a stock at day i, which means opt(i) = opt(i - 1) - prices[i - 1] + prices[i] (max Profit you can get if you sell stock at day(i-1) - money you lose if you buy the stock at day (i-1) + money you gain if you sell the stock at day i.

We do not hold a stock at day i, which means we cannot sell any stock at day i. In this case, money we can get at day i is 0;

opt(i) is the best case of 1 and 2.

So, opt(i) = Max{opt(i - 1) - prices[i - 1] + prices[i], 0}
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not prices or len(prices) == 0:
            return 0
        res, max_cur = 0, 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            max_cur = max(0, max_cur+prices[i]-prices[i-1]) # 如果今天卖相比于昨天卖能多赚，则今天卖，否则之前就卖了
            res = max(res, max_cur)
        return res
```
